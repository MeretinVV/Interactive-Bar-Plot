# Interactive-Bar-Plot

A jupyter notebook that creates an interactive bar plot that changes bars' colors depending on user's actions.
This project was an assignment for a Coursera course "Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python".

Note: you need to actually run the code in your version of Jupyter Notebook for interactivity to work.
